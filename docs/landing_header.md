# HERA: Official Documentation

Welcome to the **official documentation** for the HERA (Hierarchical-Compensatory, Effect-Size-Driven and Non-Parametric Ranking Algorithm) MATLAB toolbox.

This platform serves as the **comprehensive reference guide** for the HERA framework, systematically organizing the repository's documentation into a **centralized, wiki-style knowledge hub**.

While the [source code](https://github.com/lerdmann1601/HERA-Matlab) contains the raw files, this site is optimized to offer a **streamlined reading experience** for the entire framework—including detailed installation guides, parameter configuration, hierarchical-compensatory ranking logic, and bootstrap validation mechanisms.

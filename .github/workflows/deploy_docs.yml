          # We originally stripped the <div>, which made it left-aligned.
          # Now we keep the <div> but add 'markdown="1"' so MkDocs parses the content inside.
          # We need to enable 'md_in_html' extension in mkdocs.yml for this to work.

          # GitHub uses "> [!WARNING]", but MkDocs uses "!!! warning".
          # We simply convert the header line. The > characters in following lines
          # will make it render as a blockquote inside the warning, which looks fine.

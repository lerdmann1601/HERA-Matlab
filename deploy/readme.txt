To run HERA, you must first install the MATLAB Runtime.

- Run the "HERA_Runtime_Installer" (Application/Executable).
- Follow the on-screen instructions.
- The installer will automatically download and install the correct MATLAB Runtime (R2025b) if needed.

2. How to Run
=============

macOS:
------
1. Open the "HERA_Launcher.command" file (Double-Click).
2. A Terminal window will open and launch the application.
3. Follow the instructions in the Terminal.

Windows:
--------
1. Open "HERA_Runtime.exe" (Double-Click).
2. A Command Prompt window will open and launch the application.

Linux:
------

2. Navigate to this directory.
3. Run: ./run_HERA_Runtime.sh <Path_to_Runtime>

3. Troubleshooting
==================
- If the application closes immediately, ensure you have installed the Runtime correctly.
- On macOS, if you see a security warning, right-click the file and select "Open" to bypass the check.

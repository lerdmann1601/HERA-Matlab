=== Statistical Analysis of Differences across all Datasets in OC, CNR, SNR ===

For each dataset, mean and standard deviation were calculated for the following metric(s):
 -> OC 
 -> CNR 
 -> SNR 

Significance, Comparisons with Cliff's Delta, and Relative Mean Differences:
All 21 possible pairs of the 7 datasets from 30 subjects were compared regarding OC, CNR, SNR.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to check for a consistent and significant difference between datasets within subjects.
The effect size Cliff's Delta (+1 to -1) robustly assesses the difference between the distributions of the datasets.
Additionally, the relative mean difference between datasets is calculated as a criterion for the practical relevance of the effect.

Threshold for Cliff's Delta (lower 95% CI of the 50th percentile of Cliff's Delta of all dataset comparisons):
 OC: 1.000
 CNR: 0.311
 SNR: 1.000

Threshold for relative mean differences (lower 95% CI of the 50th percentile of relative mean differences):
 OC: 0.708
 CNR: 0.121
 SNR: 0.581

Protection against small mean differences and influence from slight noise/signal fluctuations:
-> Minimum threshold for relative mean differences based on the 95% CI of the 50th percentile of the SEM of all datasets
 OC: 0.040
 CNR: 0.076
 SNR: 0.025

Criteria for a significant and relevant comparison between two datasets:
 1. p-value is significant (Holm-Bonferroni corrected)
 2. Cliff's Delta is above the threshold
 3. Relative difference is above the threshold

A Percentile-Bootstrap with B = 1300 was used to calculate the thresholds.
A BCa-Bootstrap with B = 2700 was performed to calculate the 95% CI of the dataset comparisons.
To calculate the 95% Rank-CI of the ranking, the analysis was run in a Cluster-Bootstrap with B = 175.

=== OC Comparison: Analysis and Initial Ranking ===

1. Initial ranking formed by the number of won comparisons per dataset
Criteria for a win: p < Holm-Bonferroni threshold, Delta (d) >= 1.000, Rel. Diff. (r) >= 0.708
2. In case of a tie, Cliff's Delta (d) decides. If d = 0 the mean value is used.
